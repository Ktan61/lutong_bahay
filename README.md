# Lutong Bahay
CMPT-3170 Project
Group D3-F- 3

## Description
Our project is “Lutong Bahay”, a Filipino cookbook app that allows users to easily customize recipes. One of the key features is the ability to adjust serving sizes, so when users change the number of servings, the app automatically updates the ingredient amounts. We also included an ingredient substitution feature, which suggests alternatives for items that might be unavailable or need to be replaced due to dietary restrictions. This makes it easier for users to cook Filipino dishes no matter where they are or what ingredients they have on hand.

## Main Web App Features
Shows different Filipino recipes with: instructions, ingredients, videos/pictures, and ratings. Recipes will be added by App admin only but users can add reviews or suggestions, and ratings.
Allows users to change portion sizes and substitute ingredients based on dietary preferences. Changing portion sizes/dietary preferences will be chips on the page that you can toggle to change the information.
Users can add ingredients to shopping list by pressing a button. The shopping list will be visible on another page. 
We provide suggestions where to get specialty ingredients. Specialty items will have an icon that links to information on stores that provide these items, based on admin’s knowledge.
